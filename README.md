# About Me
I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Statistics at California State University East Bay.
When I was a clinical laboratory associate at Guardant Health, I had the opportunity to analyze oncology machinery operations data using Excel which sparked my interest in data analytics.
I pursued a certificate in Healthcare Analytics to better understand how programming languages such as SAS and SQL can be used to make statistical inferences.
