# About Me

When I was a clinical laboratory associate at Guardant Health, I had the opportunity to analyze oncology machinery operational data using Excel which sparked my interest in data analytics.
I pursued a certificate in Healthcare Analytics to better understand how programming languages such as SAS and SQL can be used to make statistical inferences.

Today I am currently pursuing a Master's in Statistics concentration in Data Science at California State University East Bay. My goal is to advance my technical skillset in programming languages such as R and utilize statistical knowledge to help make data-driven insights and decisions that will make positive and transformative impacts to the lives of others.
I would like to introduce you four projects I have completed in the past few years using SAS, SQL, or R.
