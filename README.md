# About Me

My interest in data analytics and science sparked when I had the opportunity to analyze oncology machinery data using Excel. In 1.5 years, I received my Healthcare Analytics certificate from UC Davis. In May 2023, I'm proud to announce I have received my Master's in Statistics concentration in Data Science from California State University East Bay.

My focus is in healthcare and public health data as the appeal is to mitigate **$800 billion** in fraud, waste, and abuse annually so taxpayer money can be better utilized at improving health.
