# About Me

When I was a clinical laboratory associate at Guardant Health, I had the opportunity to analyze oncology machinery operations data using Excel which sparked my interest in data analytics.
I pursued a certificate in Healthcare Analytics to better understand how programming languages such as SAS and SQL can be used to make statistical inferences.

Today I am currently pursuing a Master's in Statistics at California State University East Bay. My goal is to advance my technical skillset in programming languages such as R and utilize statistical knowledge to help make data-driven insights and decisions that will make positive and transformative impacts to the lives of others.
I would like to introduce you three projects I have completed in the past few years using SAS, SQL, or R.
1. Do high levels of cholesterol increase your odds of having hypertension?
2. Predicting length of stay in beneficiaries using county-level profiling and multiple linear regression on Medicare claims data
3.
